# Semiconductor Materials Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and simulates the properties of III-V semiconductor materials and their ternary alloys, focusing on their application in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The code provides calculations and visualizations for band gap, lattice constant, spin-orbit splitting, and quantum well properties, including the effects of strain and temperature.

## Tasks and Descriptions

1. **Plot band gap, lattice constant, and spin-orbit splitting vs. average atomic number for III-V binary compounds.**
   - Explains chemical trends and their physical origins.

2. **For a selected ternary alloy:**
   - Plots band gap and lattice constant as a function of mixing parameter x.

3. **Plots band gap vs. temperature (0–300K) for x=0.25, 0.5, 0.75.**

4. **Plots logarithm of resistivity vs. inverse temperature (50–300K) for x=0.25, 0.5, 0.75.**

5. **Plots positions of valence and conduction band extrema, band gap, and strain as a function of mixing parameter.**
   - Includes both strained and unstrained cases, and for two different substrates.

6. **Plots the profile of a type-I rectangular quantum well with a ternary alloy as the well and a selected binary compound as the barrier.**
   - Includes strain in the well layer.

7. **Solves the quantum well from (7) assuming constant mass throughout the structure.**
